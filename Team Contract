# Daily process

- Morning standup started by yesterday's Taskmaster
  - New roles assigned (by yesterday’s Taskmaster)
  - Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (by today’s Taskmaster)
- Morning standup is deciding on tasks for the day, what to focus on, what blocking issues exist that are stopping others from progressing
- Pair program on assigned tasks
- Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss after lunch at re-group meeting
- Bring up any blocking issues after 20-30 minutes of spinning your wheels
- Share your code in Slack before pulling someone in, in case it’s an easy fix that just needs a second set of eyes
- 1p - 230p EST lunch
- At 2:30pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge
- If no after-lunch meeting is needed, slack that information to your teammates
- Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master

# Team expectations

- Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
- Coding after-hours is allowed, but continue to remain communicative
- If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
- We will assign tasks vertically (full features rather than “all frontend” or “all backend”)
- None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
- Don’t interrupt teammates
- Be communicative

# Issues

- If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
- Take 10-15 minute break
- List out the pros / cons
- Vote on it
- If the vote is split, leave it up to the gods of chance and flip a coin
- Absolute last resort is escalating to the project manager. We are all adults and can handle issues internally.

# If you are frustrated

- Take a walk or get some water
- Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
- Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated
- Be an adult, you know how you best handle tilt.

# Summary

- Be an adult, don’t be a jerk
- Practice “yes, and…” to build on each others’ ideas
- Remain communicative
