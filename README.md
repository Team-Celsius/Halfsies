# Halfsies

- Halfsies is a mobile app that makes splitting the tab with your friends simple.
- Take a picture of your receipt, and allow our Ocular Character Recognition, or OCR technology to itemize line-by-line.
- Once you're happy with itemization, simply assign your friends to charges and make sure nobody skips the bill on you.

## Getting Started

To run: `npm i` for all dependencies, followed by `npx expo start` to run expo. You'll need the mobile app 'Expo Go'
