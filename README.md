- Halfsies is a mobile app that makes splitting the tab with your friends simple.
- Take a picture of your receipt, and allow our Ocular Character Recognition, or OCR technology to itemize line-by-line.
- Once you're happy with itemization, simply assign your friends to charges and make sure nobody skips the bill on you.
- Built with React Native, Native Base, Expo, and Google Cloud Vision AI.
- Deployed via Firebase.

## Getting Started
